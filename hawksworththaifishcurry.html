    <div class="ingredients">
        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

        <h3>For the Curry Paste:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 shallots, peeled and sliced</li>

            <li>200g (4–5 small) Japanese eggplants</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>

    <div class="method">
        <h2>METHOD</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Crafting the Curry Paste:</h3>
                <p>This is where the magic begins, unlocking the vibrant aromas that will define your curry.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, toast your <strong>coriander seeds</strong>. Place them in a dry skillet over medium heat and shake the pan constantly until they become wonderfully fragrant and just begin to pop and turn a shade darker, about 1-2 minutes. Keep a close eye on them, as they can go from toasted to burnt in a flash!</li>
                    <li>Combine the <strong>shallots, ginger, garlic, toasted coriander seeds, lime leaves, bruised and chopped lemongrass, and chopped jalapeño</strong> in a food processor. Process until you have a coarse paste. Don't worry if it's not perfectly smooth just yet; we're building layers.</li>
                    <li>Transfer this paste to a blender. Now, add the <strong>canola oil, basil leaves, and cilantro</strong>. Blend on high speed until the paste is as smooth as you can get it. Scrape down the sides as needed to ensure everything is incorporated. You'll notice the color become a deeper, richer green as the herbs break down. This smooth paste is the aromatic heart of our curry.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Building the Coconut Curry Base:</h3>
                <p>This base is where all those glorious flavors marry and meld, creating a rich and savory foundation for your fish.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, melt the <strong>solid coconut oil</strong> over medium heat. You'll see a shimmering sheen on the surface once it's ready—this is the perfect temperature to begin.</li>
                    <li>Add your freshly made <strong>curry paste</strong>, along with the <strong>fish sauce</strong> and <strong>brown sugar</strong>, to the melted coconut oil. Now, this is an important moment: we're going to "toast" the paste. Stir constantly for about 1 minute, allowing the paste to bloom and release its intense fragrance. You'll smell it deepen and become more complex, but be careful not to let it brown too much; we want fragrant, not burnt.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the <strong>coconut milk</strong> and bring it to a boil. Once it's bubbling, reduce the heat immediately to a gentle simmer. Resist the urge to cover the pot. We want a steady, gentle simmer for about 45 minutes, allowing the liquid to reduce to about 1.5L (6 cups). This concentration is key to a flavorful curry.</li>
                    <li>After 45 minutes, carefully ladle out about 1 cup of the simmering coconut curry base into a blender. Add the <strong>deseeded jalapeño</strong> to this portion. Blend on high for a good 30 seconds until completely smooth. This little trick adds a fresh burst of chile flavor without the raw heat. Stir this blended mixture back into the main pot of curry base.</li>
                    <li>Now for the final seasoning. Taste the base. Is it singing? Add the <strong>salt</strong> a little at a time, tasting as you go. Remember, you can always add more, but you can't take it away! Then, stir in the <strong>lime juice</strong>. The acidity from the lime will brighten and balance the richness of the coconut milk and the warmth of the spices. Taste again. It should be a beautiful harmony of salty, sweet, spicy, and tangy.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Roasting the Vegetables:</h3>
                <p>Roasting these vegetables brings out their inherent sweetness and adds a lovely textural contrast to the soft fish.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 212°C (415°F).</li>
                    <li>Take your <strong>Japanese eggplants</strong>. Slice them in half lengthwise, then cut them into 1–1.5cm (⅜–½ inch) thick half-moons. Toss them gently with a pinch of <strong>salt</strong> and a drizzle of <strong>olive oil</strong> on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Arrange them in a single layer so they can roast evenly. Pop them in the hot oven for about 10 minutes, or until they're beautifully golden brown and tender. Keep the oven on!</li>
                    <li>Next, prepare your <strong>sweet potatoes</strong>. Cut them into 2cm (¾ inch) cubes (no need to peel them, the skin adds character and nutrients!). Toss them with a dash of <strong>olive oil</strong> and a pinch of <strong>salt</strong>. Spread them in a single layer on another parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast them in the same oven for about 15 minutes, or until they're cooked through, with wonderfully caramelized edges. Set them aside for now.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Assembling and Finishing the Thai Fish Curry:</h3>
                <p>The grand finale! This is where everything comes together in a symphony of flavors and textures.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring your glorious <strong>coconut curry base</strong> back to a gentle boil in a large pot.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the heat to a simmer and gently add your <strong>cubed rockfish or halibut</strong>. These delicate fillets will cook quickly, so we're looking for just 3 to 5 minutes of simmering, until the fish is just cooked through and flakes easily. Overcooked fish is a sad thing indeed!</li>
                    <li>In the very last minute of cooking, stir in your beautifully roasted <strong>eggplant and sweet potatoes</strong>. Allow them to warm through and mingle with the curry.</li>
                    <li>Ladle the fragrant curry into warm serving bowls. Garnish generously with the thinly sliced <strong>jalapeño</strong> (for a little fresh pop of heat and color) and fresh <strong>cilantro sprigs</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately with steamed jasmine rice. Each spoonful will be a delight!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
