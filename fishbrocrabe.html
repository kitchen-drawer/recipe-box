    <h1>Halibut with Blistered Broccoli Rabe & Savory Sauce</h1>

    <p>This dish celebrates the delicate, flaky texture of halibut nestled in a lively, verdant sauce made from tender broccoli rabe, infused with the savory depth of garlic, anchovy, and a hint of spice. The magic happens quickly, with the fish getting a golden sear and the sauce coming together with remarkable ease. The trick here is to embrace the character of the broccoli rabe – a slight bitterness that pairs beautifully with the rich fish and bright notes in the sauce.</p>

    <p><strong>Yields:</strong> 4 servings</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>3/4 pound (about 340g) peeled yellow-fleshed potatoes, such as yellow Finnish, Bintje, or German Butterballs, cut into irregular bite-sized chunks (if serving with roasted potatoes)</li>
        <li>4 pieces skinless halibut fillets, about 6 ounces (170g) each and 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick (avoiding tail pieces)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes, a generous pinch (or to taste)</li>
        <li>4 oil-packed anchovy fillets</li>
        <li>1 large bunch broccoli rabe (about 1 pound/450g), stalks trimmed, leaves cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) chicken stock (or vegetable stock)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (about 1 ounce/28g) finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar (optional, for finishing)</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter: 1 stick (1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>Leeks: 1 large</li>
        <li>Thyme: 1 small bunch</li>
        <li>Dry vermouth (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Large wide heavy sauté pan, ovenproof</li>
        <li>Blender or food processor</li>
        <li>Small, shallow platter or serving plates</li>
        <li>Spatula and tongs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the Potatoes (if using):</strong> If you're serving this with roasted potatoes, this is where you'll begin. Place your irregularly cut potato chunks in a saucepan and cover them with cold water. Now, here’s a crucial step for flavor: season the water liberally with salt. I mean <em>liberally</em> – the water should taste as seasoned as you'd like your finished potatoes to be. Bring them to a gentle simmer over medium heat and cook for about 5 minutes, until they’re quite tender and their edges are soft, almost ready to give way. This slight diffusion of the potato will later contribute to the dish’s wonderfully homey character. Drain them thoroughly.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the Halibut:</strong> While your potatoes are simmering (or just before you start cooking if you're skipping the potatoes), season your halibut fillets lightly and evenly all over with salt. Cover them loosely and pop them in the refrigerator. Giving them this little head start with the salt will draw out moisture and contribute to a beautifully firm texture and enhanced flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Blanch the Broccoli Rabe:</strong> Bring a pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add your trimmed and cut broccoli rabe to the boiling water and blanch for just about 1-2 minutes until it's vibrant green and tender-crisp. Immediately drain the broccoli rabe and shock it in an ice bath to stop the cooking, then drain it again, leaving it a little damp. That dampness is important—it helps the rabe steam and wilt nicely when it hits the hot pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Start the Broccoli Rabe Base:</strong> Grab your large, wide heavy sauté pan and set it over medium heat. Add the 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Let it heat until it’s shimmering and almost smoking. Now, add your thinly sliced garlic, red pepper flakes, and those savory anchovy fillets. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for about 2 minutes, until the garlic is lightly golden and fragrant. You'll notice the anchovies practically melt into the oil, creating a beautiful depth of flavor. Add the blanched, slightly damp broccoli rabe to the pan and carefully toss everything together. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Remove this mixture from the heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Create the Broccoli Rabe Sauce:</strong> Transfer about half of your cooked broccoli rabe mixture to a blender or food processor. Pour in the 1 cup of chicken stock and purée until it’s just smooth – you want it velvety, not aerated. Take the remaining half of the sautéed broccoli rabe and coarsely chop it. Now, combine the puréed broccoli rabe, the coarsely chopped broccoli rabe, the Pecorino Romano cheese, and the 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil in a mixing bowl. Stir everything together until it's thoroughly incorporated. This gives you a lovely contrast of smooth and textured in your sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat for the Halibut:</strong> Preheat your broiler now, positioning the rack about 6 inches from the element. While it's preheating, transfer your drained, still steaming potatoes to a 12- or 14-inch ovenproof skillet.</li>
        <li><strong>Sear and Simmer the Halibut:</strong> Return the same wide, heavy skillet you used for the broccoli rabe (or a clean one) to medium-high heat. Add the canola oil and let it get shimmering and almost smoking. Season your chilled halibut fillets with salt and pepper, giving the skin side (if there were skin) a little extra love. Gently place the fillets, skin-side down, into the hot pan. You should hear a satisfying sizzle! Cook for about 5 minutes, until the bottoms are beautifully golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Flip and Finish in the Oven:</strong> Gently turn the fillets over with tongs or a spatula. Now, here’s where the broiler comes in. Add the leeks, thyme, about 1 cup of the chicken stock, and a splash of vermouth (if using) to the skillet with the potatoes. Set this pan over medium heat and swirl as the broth comes to a simmer. Add about 4 tablespoons of the chilled, sliced unsalted butter and swirl until it melts. Taste this broth for salt – it should be delicious on its own. Reduce the heat to low and carefully add the seared fish to this simmering broth. Swirl and tilt the pan to baste the surface of the fish with that lovely buttery broth. You’ll notice the liquid level rise as the halibut releases its own moisture into the broth. If it doesn’t quite cover the fish or seems a bit low, add a little more chicken stock. Make sure no bits of leek are stuck to the sides of the pan or marooned on top of the fish.</li>
        <li><strong>Broil and Cook:</strong> Carefully place the pan under the preheated broiler. Cook until the surface of the fish and potatoes is lightly gratinéed, about 5 to 6 minutes. The liquid should be bubbling vigorously. At this point, reduce your oven temperature to 500°F. Continue to cook for another 1 to 5 minutes, until the fish is medium-rare and flakes easily with a fork, but is still moist and translucent in the center.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Refine the Sauce:</strong> While the fish finishes, warm a small, shallow platter and your serving plates in the oven for a minute or so, then remove them. Transfer the fish pan to the stovetop. Using a spatula and tongs, lift the fish, tilting it slightly to drain any excess liquid back into the pan, then place it on your warm platter, protected from drafts. Don't stack the pieces—we want them to finish cooking gently as they rest. Swirl the pan gently over medium heat to encourage the potatoes to break down a bit and thicken the sauce as it simmers. Taste it. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter and adjust the salt as needed. Now, tilt the platter with the resting fish over the pan and carefully drain any collected liquid from the fish into the simmering sauce – this is pure flavor! Continue simmering to reduce the sauce until it has a little body and coats the back of a spoon. Taste again. If it seems a little flat, a splash of Champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar will brighten it beautifully. Resist the urge for lemon here; its strong perfume can easily overpower the delicate flavors of this dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Transfer the perfectly cooked halibut fillets to your warmed plates. Spoon the rich, velvety broccoli rabe sauce and potatoes generously over and around the fish. Serve immediately.</li>
